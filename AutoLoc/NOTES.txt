Work on Regular Expression patterns for the following file types to enhance the string marking and extraction to:
    - avoid source code literals among user-facing texts.
    - consider only the obvious translatable strings in marking and extraction.

Work on the classes in the following order:
1. JS
2. JSX (adapting JS to JSX)
3. TS 
4. TSX 
5. EJS
6. VUE 

Work on HTML separately after deploying RMI source code.
