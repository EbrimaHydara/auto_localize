UPDATES ON HTMLFileLocalizer:

Current Prompt:


Update the HTMLFileLocalizer class as follows:


- Add a function or functions to check for and remove any duplicated value in the JSON files. Only the first instance of duplicated values is retained while the others removed from the JSON file together with their keys.
- Add a function or functions to update the data-i18n attributes in all HTML files to have the UUID keys of the values in the JSON files equal to/the same as their tag contents. 



- Duplicated HTML files for each locale should be next to the original HTML file in the following order as example:
    - index.html (original)
    - en/en_US_index.html
    - zh/zh_CN_index.html
- For every original HTML and its duplicates for each locale, their navigation links must be relative to each other based on the original HTML file's directory. The _insert_navigation_links() function must render the navigation links in this manner. 
- Update the _save_json_file such that every HTML file renders its text from a JSON file inside its parent directory structure corresponding to it. The locale directories must be next to the original HTML file as:
- index.html (original) (gets its text from ja/html_strings_ja_JP.json next to it).
- ja/html_strings_ja_JP.json 
- en/en_US_index.html (gets gets its text from en/html_strings_en_US.json next to it)
- en/html_strings_en_US.json
- zh/zh_CN_index.html
- zh/html_strings_zh_CN.json 
- Every JSON file must contain a comment at the top as the first line before the JSON content which indicates the full path of the JSON file.


- Adjust to remove the double rendered "<script><script>" tags by the _insert_i18next_logic() function.
- Update the _insert_i18next_logic() function to load the JSON files' relative paths based on the "locales" directory instead of the root directory.



- Write a function to get and populate all JSON files of the source and target locales in the source tree of the root dir (recursively) inside the locales directory. 
- Write a function that replaces the contents of the individual JSON files in the source tree of the root dir with their corresponding JSON files' contents based on their full/absolute paths in their comments at the top of the JSON file.
