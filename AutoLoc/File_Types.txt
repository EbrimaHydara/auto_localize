Here is the revised list of file types grouped by their contextâ€”whether they are used in a web app, Android app, iOS app, or Java app. I've removed any file types that do not fit into these specific contexts.

Grouped File Types by Context:

1. Web App:
- Markup Files:
  - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): `.html`

- Script Files:
  - JavaScript: `.js`
  - Embedded JavaScript (EJS): `.ejs`
  - TypeScript: `.ts`
  - TypeScript XML (TSX): `.tsx`
  - React JSX (JavaScript XML): `.jsx`
  - Vue Single-File Component: `.vue`

- Resource-Based Files:
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): `.json` (often used for storing localization data)



2. Android App:
- Markup Files:
  - Android Layout XML Files: `.xml` (e.g., `activity_main.xml`)

- Code Files:
  - Java Source File: `.java`
  - Kotlin Source File: `.kt`

- Resource-Based Files:
  - Android Resource Files: `.xml` (e.g., `strings.xml`, `plurals.xml`, `arrays.xml`)

- Configuration Files:
  - Android Manifest File: `.xml` (e.g., `AndroidManifest.xml`)




3. iOS App:
- Code Files:
  - Swift Source File: `.swift`
  - Objective-C Implementation File: `.m`
  - Objective-C Header File: `.h`

- Resource-Based Files:
  - iOS Localizable Strings File: `.strings`

- Markup and Layout Files:
  - Storyboard Interface File: `.storyboard`
  - XIB Interface Builder File: `.xib`

- Configuration Files:
  - Property List Files (iOS): `.plist` (e.g., `Info.plist`)




4. Java App:
- Markup Files:
  - JSF View Files (JavaServer Faces View File): `.xhtml`
  - XML (Extensible Markup Language): `.xml` (used for various configurations)

- Code Files:
  - Java Source File: `.java`

- Resource-Based Files:
  - Java Properties File: `.properties` (e.g., `messages_en.properties`)

- Configuration Files:
  - JSF Faces Configuration Files: `.xml` (e.g., `faces-config.xml`)

Summary:

- Web App Context:
  - Focuses on files typically found in web development frameworks and environments, including JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML templates, and server-side rendering files.

- Android App Context:
  - Includes files specific to Android development, such as Java/Kotlin source files, XML layout files, and Android-specific resource files.

- iOS App Context:
  - Covers files used in iOS app development, such as Swift/Objective-C source files, `.strings` files for localization, and storyboard or XIB files for UI design.

- Java App Context:
  - Encompasses files commonly used in Java desktop or server-side applications, particularly with JavaServer Faces (JSF) and other Java frameworks.

By organizing the file types in this manner, you can better manage localization tasks specific to each platform or framework.
