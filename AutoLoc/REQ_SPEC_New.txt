Requirements Specification for AutoLoc App and Plugin:

Introduction:

This document provides an in-depth description of 
the technical and functional requirements for 
the AutoLoc script and the AutoLoc plugin. 
These components are independently crucial for 
automating the localization process of websites 
and for seamless integration with various 
Content Management Systems (CMS). 
The specifications detailed herein are intended 
to furnish developers, end-users, and other 
stakeholders with a clear understanding of 
the operational procedures, setup requirements, 
and functionalities of the AutoLoc script and plugin.

Part 1: AutoLoc Script for Website Localization:

Detailed Overview:

The AutoLoc script is a Python application designed 
for operation from the Command Line Interface (CLI). 
Its primary function is to automate the extraction 
of translatable strings from website files, 
such as HTML and JavaScript, and manage these 
strings by populating them into structured JSON 
files tailored to each required locale.

Detailed Requirements:

Extraction and Management of Translatable Strings:

The script is required to meticulously scan 
through HTML, JavaScript, and other files that 
may contain hard-coded strings intended for translation. 
It should extract these strings and systematically 
populate them into designated JSON files. 
Each locale requested by the user results in 
a separate JSON file specifically for that locale.

Locale Management:

The script must support multiple locales simultaneously. 
For each locale, a unique JSON file is created. 
The naming convention for each JSON file should 
reflect its locale (e.g., `en_us.json` for 
American English, `fr_fr.json` for French).

Replacement with String Identifiers:

After extracting the strings, the script must 
replace the original content within the HTML and 
JavaScript files with unique string IDs. 
These IDs serve as string variables pointing to 
content from the corresponding JSON files.

Integration with Translation Management Server (TMS):

A pivotal feature of the script is its ability 
to interface efficiently with a Translation Management 
Server (TMS), which oversees the translation of 
the extracted JSON files.

The TMS is responsible for detecting modifications 
in these files, updating them with the appropriate 
translations, and pushing the translated content 
back to the source code repository.

Client-Side Integration Requirements:

Clients are expected to manually integrate 
the updated source code, which includes 
the latest translations, into their live websites. 
They must also shift from hard-coding strings 
directly into HTML or JavaScript files to managing 
these strings via the JSON files created by AutoLoc, 
aligning with the localization structure proposed 
by AutoLoc.

Functionality for Language Switching:

The script should support a feature that allows 
website visitors to switch between the languages 
available on the website. Upon selecting a language 
from a dropdown menu, the website’s content should 
automatically update by fetching the corresponding 
translations from the JSON files located in 
the “translations” directory.

Continuous Localization Process:

The ongoing process of localization, including 
translation reviews, validations, and 
the automatic updating of translated files, 
should be comprehensively managed by the TMS.



Part 2: AutoLoc Plugin for CMS Integration:

Detailed Overview:

The AutoLoc plugin is designed to facilitate 
the integration of translation processes into 
various CMS platforms, ensuring that content 
management is both dynamic and localized.

Detailed Requirements:

Development for Specific CMS:

Each CMS supported by AutoLoc necessitates 
the development of a unique version of the plugin, 
crafted in the CMS's native programming language.

Automated Translation Management:

The plugin must automate the transmission 
of content from the CMS to the TMS for 
translation and handle the reception of 
translated text from the TMS via APIs.

Database Schema Management:

A crucial function of the plugin is to create 
or update the CMS’s database schema to support 
the new locales effectively. It must manage 
the activation of these new locales within 
the CMS seamlessly.

Management of Translated Content:

The plugin is responsible for collecting newly 
translated strings from the TMS and accurately 
posting them to their respective tables within 
the CMS database.


Summary:

This concise document articulates the comprehensive 
specifications for the AutoLoc script and plugin, 
delineating each step and requirement to ensure 
clarity and facilitate effective implementation. 
By adhering to these detailed specifications, 
developers and clients can achieve a robust 
implementation of website localization and CMS 
integration, thereby enhancing global accessibility 
and usability of content across diverse linguistic 
demographics.
