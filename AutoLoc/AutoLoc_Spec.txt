Requirements Specification for the AutoLoc App:

Overview:

AutoLoc is a sophisticated app designed for automating the localization process of websites and mobile apps. It extracts all translatable texts from the website's or mobile app's source code across various file types and converts them into locale resource files, facilitating easy translation. The application is developed using PySide6 Python framework and other relevant Python libraries.

Key Features:

Automatic Text Extraction:

Supports multiple file types.
Extracts translatable texts into resource files for each specified file type.
Users can define which file types to localize.

Localized Text Rendering:

The extracted texts in the appropriate format can be rendered back into the website or mobile app, maintaining the correct localization.

Class-based File Handling:

Each file type has a specific class that manages its localization process, ensuring appropriate handling according to file type characteristics.

Installation and Compatibility:

Compatible with all major operating systems.
Includes an installer that handles the installation of all dependencies.
The app is accessible via a UI icon, making it user-friendly and easy to execute.

Code and Functionality Definitions:

Class Definitions:

The following is the definition of each class's functionality and implementation logic. The classes are developed in the following logical order to faciliate a smooth definition of the interrelationship among them. Inheritances will be explicitly defined by indicating which class inherits which class in the following definiton. Each class's functionality will also be described and finetuned as appropriate during the course of development. The logical order in which classes are defined is as follows:
- managers module classes
- localizers module classes
- app_ui module classes 




Classes: managers module classes:

    - AppManager class:
        - The AppManager ensures the following at the AutoLoc app startup:
            - There must be a "[Host OS User Data Directory]AutoLoc/" directory created during the app's installation in the host operating system (OS). The AppManager checks if this directory exists, otherwise it creates it. 

            - The AppManager checks if there is an "autoloc.db" file inside the "[Host OS User Data Directory]AutoLoc/Data/DB/" directory created during installation of the app on the host OS, otherwise, it creates it at app startup by calling the DBManager to create the DB file.

            - The AppManager handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable later in a QMessageBox in the MainAppWindow class if there is any Exception/Error preventing the above procedures.
        
        - The AppManager is responsible for any OS specific definitions such as the creation of the "[Host OS User Data Directory]AutoLoc/Data/" directory based on the host OS the app is running. The [Host OS User Data Directory] represents any OS (Windows, Mac, and Linux) user data directory.

            - copy_source_code_files(source_code_upload_path) funtion to copy all the files from the source_code_upload_path maintaining the directories and files patterns of the source code into the original_source_code_path.
            It then copies all the contents of the original_source_code_path to the localized_source_code_path. This function handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable later in a QMessageBox.

        - Please understand that the QMessageBoxes are not created within this class. This class only creates and returns the exceptions/errors strings through its functions to be displayed later in any corresponding QWidget class that will call this class's functions.



    - L10nManager class:
        - The L10nManager defines and executes all localization management procedures of the app. 
        - It inherits the FileManager class.
        - It defines and executes the following functions and functionalities:
            
            - localize_source_code() function to call the required classes from the localizers module to localize the files based on the source code's "type" attribute value. The specific class from the localizers module is called based on the "type" attribute of the source code as follows:
                - if type = "Web App", then WebAppBasedLocalizer is called 
                - if type = "Android App", then AndroidAppBasedLocalizer is called 
                - if type = "iOS App", then IOSAppBasedLocalizer is called 
                - if type = "Java App", then JavaAppBasedLocalizer is called
            When the function calls the appropriate class based on the source code's type attribute value, it passes it all the required arguments to initialize and execute its localization logic.  
            This function handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable later in a QMessageBox. 

        - Please understand that the QMessageBoxes are not created within this class. This class only creates and returns the exceptions/errors strings through its functions to be displayed later in any corresponding QWidget class that will call this class's functions.




Classes: localizers module classes:

    - web_localizers module classes:

        - WebAppBasedLocalizer class:
            - The WebAppBasedLocalizer is the class responsible for localizing the source code having type = "Web App".
            - It inherits the FileManager class.
            - It implements and executes the following functions and functionalities:
                - get_file_type_counts() function to get all the file paths from the original_source_code_path and count each file type based on their file extension and record the count of each file extension in a the dictionary it returns.

                - process_l10n() function that gets the dictionary returned from get_file_type_counts() function and if it is not empty, it executes the required file handler class for every file extension whose count is greater than zero. It uses if statements to control which classes gets executed only when its corresponding file extension count is greater than zero. If all none of the file extension counts is greater than zero, then this function throws and returns the necessary errors/exceptions. 
                This function handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable later in a QMessageBox.

        - 





Classes: app_ui module classes and starter file:

    App's starter file:

    - autoloc.py file:
        - The autoloc.py file is the only entry point of the AutoLoc app.
        - It calls the MainAppWindow and executes the Application to render the app's UI.
        - It is the AutoLoc app's only allowed entry point of execution.




    - MainAppWindow Class:
        - The MainAppWindow is the main class of the AutoLoc app. It consolidates all the other classes logic in one place. It is the only class called in the autoloc.py file to start and run the app. 
        - It calls the AppManager and the DBManager to execute startup procedures as the first procedures of the app.
        - It makes sure the AppManager passes on all its startup procedures without any failure before any other process is allowed on the app.
        - It defines the AutoLoc app's main layout which includes the following layouts with their corresponding widgets:
            - main_layout: MainAppWindow's layout 
            - header_layout: in main_layout to accommodate HeaderWidget
            - side_bar_layout: in main_layout to accommodate SideBarWidget
            - footer_layout: in main_layout to accommodate FooterWidget
            - panel_layout: in main_layout to accommodate PanelWidget
            - The PanelWidget will accommodate any other QWidget class defined below. 
            - An image showing each QWidget's layout and internal widget components will be provided for its design and functionalities.
