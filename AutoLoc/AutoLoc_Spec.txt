Requirements Specification for the AutoLoc App:

Overview:

AutoLoc is a sophisticated app designed for automating the localization process of websites and mobile apps. It extracts all translatable texts from the website's or mobile app's source code across various file types and converts them into JSON files, facilitating easy translation. The application is developed using PySide6 Python framework and other relevant Python libraries.

Key Features:

Automatic Text Extraction:

Supports multiple file types.
Extracts translatable texts into JSON files for each specified file type.
Users can define which file types to localize.

Localized Text Rendering:

The extracted texts in JSON format can be rendered back into the website or mobile app, maintaining the correct localization.

Class-based File Handling:

Each file type has a specific class that manages its localization process, ensuring appropriate handling according to file type characteristics.

Installation and Compatibility:

Compatible with all major operating systems.
Includes an installer that handles the installation of all dependencies.
The app is accessible via a UI icon, making it user-friendly and easy to execute.

Usage:

Upon launching, users can select the website's or mobile app's root directory through a provided button.
The chosen path is registered as the source directory.
A "locales" directory is created within this source directory to store resource files for each locale.
AutoLoc streamlines the localization workflow, making it a vital tool for developers aiming to internationalize their source code efficiently.

    - autoloc.py (app's starter)


Code and Functionality Definitions:

App's starter file:

autoloc.py 
    - Calls the AppManager to execute startup procedures before calling the MainAppWindow to show the app's UI:
        - The AppManager ensures the following at the AutoLoc app startup:
            - There must be an "AutoLoc" directory created during the app's installation in the host operating system (OS). The AppManager checks if this directory exists, otherwise it creates it. 
            - The AppManager checks if there is an "autoloc.db" file inside the "AutoLoc/DB/" directory created during installation of the app on the host OS, otherwise, it creates it at app startup by calling the DBManager to create the DB file.
            - The AppManager throws and shows errors in QMessageBox if there is any Exception/Error preventing the above procedures. The AppManager class should all the different and possible Exceptions/Errors handling logic to display in a QMessageBox if they occur. The QMessageBox should also advise the user on what to do to mitigate and fix the error. 

    - Calls the MainAppWindow and executes the Application to start the UI if the AppManager passes on all its startup procedures without any failure.

    - Note that the autoloc.py file is the AutoLoc app's only entry point.




Class Definitions:

The following is the definition of each class's functionality and implementation logic. The classes are developed in the following logical order to faciliate a smooth definition of the interrelationship among them. Inheritances will be explicitly defined by indicating which class inherits which class in the following definiton. Each class's functionality will also be described and finetuned as appropriate during the course of development. The logical order in which classes are defined is as follows:
- managers module classes
- localizers module classes
- app_ui module classes

It saves both the file duplicate and the resource file based on the output_pattern ("Saved Next to Original", "Saved in "locales" Directory") attribute of its corresponding project_source_code_file_type. 
            This function handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable in a QMessageBox in the ProjectSourceCodeWidget class.
    



    - L10nManager class:
        - The L10nManager inherits the FilesManager class.
        - It imports and initializes all the classes in the "localizers" module.
        - It defines and executes the following functions and functionalities:

            - localize_source_code() function that takes in the returned list of dictionaries from get_project_source_code_grouped_files() function and checks for each group in the list:
                - if the group's extension is ".html" then it calls the HTMLFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the HTML files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".js" then it calls the JSFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the JS files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".ejs" then it calls the EJSFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the EJS files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".ts" then it calls the TSFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the TS files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".tsx" then it calls the TSXFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the TSX files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".json" then it calls the JSONFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the JSON files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".csv" then it calls the CSVFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the CSV files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".pdf" then it calls the PDFFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the PDF files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".xml" then it calls the XMLFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the XML files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".properties" then it calls the PropertyFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the Property files in the groups list.
                - if the group's extension is ".strings" then it calls the StringsFilesLocalizer class of the localizers module and gives it as input/argument only the dictionary containing the Strings files in the groups list.
            This function handles and returns all possible exceptions and errors displayable in a QMessageBox in the ProjectSourceCodeWidget class.



Classes: localizers module classes:
