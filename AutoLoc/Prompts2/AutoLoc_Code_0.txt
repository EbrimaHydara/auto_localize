I want you to help me write a README.md file and an execution script file in Python to execute an automatic localization script-based app to localize any kind of source code files from a source locale to many target locales. The script-based app is called `AutoLoc` and it is developed in Python, its libraries, and dependencies.

Please read the AutoLoc app's code in the following text files provided below. The app has been developed so far using the codes in the following text files. Please say DONE after reading each file attached below. I will let you know when the files to be attached are completed and will give you specific prompts for any further tasks required.
