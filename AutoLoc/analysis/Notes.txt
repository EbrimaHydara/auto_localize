    - Only img tags with alt attributes having text are marked.
    - Only meta tags with name="description", or name="author", property="og:title", or property="og:description" or property="og:site_name", or property="og:site_name" are marked to extract their "content" attribute texts. 


- A Nav tag is not marked if it contains a target tag or a special tag.
