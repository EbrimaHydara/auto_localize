Rakuten Mobile Website JavaScript Structural Analysis

Spotted Issues:
    May require decision from client side...

1. Date Picker library for Japanese version used.
    There is a need to adjust to using other language 
    versions of the library.


2. Error messages and notifications rendered in JS.
    There might be a need to render such strings based on 
    locales. 


3. JSON files containing product rendering code and
    textual contents.


4. PDF files containing campaigns, adverts, contract 
    procedures, and etc. rendered in UI or as links. 


5. A lot of Embedded JS (.ejs) files rendering HTML dynamically.
    Will require special parser or RegEx for localization.
    Some texts are JS generated including variables 
    and some are HTML embedded.


6. TSX (TypeScript + JSX React) files rendering plain texts
    and HTML embedded texts.


7. Vue files rendering forms with select fields and options
    dynamically prepopulated.
    Some Vue files render HTML content: search results, etc.


8. Different UI tech used to render UI content.
